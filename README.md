## BackUpr

### Description

Backupsytem to Database. The system has a ".config" File that determines the files that are saved. The backup is done in set intervals. The files are then saved on a database named backUpr, that gets called by the script.

The script checks if the selected file is saved correctly on the database.

The result of the backup is documented in a log file named log.txt.

In the log.txt successful backups start with SUCCESS and errors start with ERROR followed by the time and a success message/error message.
